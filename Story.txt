Once upon a time there were three bears: Father Bear, Mother
Bear and Baby Bear. Father Bear was very big. Baby Bear was very
small. Mother Bear was not very big and not very small – she was
middle sized. The three bears lived in a little house in the forest

Every day the bears ate porridge for breakfast. One day Father
Bear said in his deep Father Bear voice, “Our porridge is too hot.
We can go and walk in the forest while it is getting cool.” So the
three bears went out for a walk in the forest. At the same time,
somebody else was walking in the forest. A little girl with golden
hair. Do you know her name? It was Goldilocks. She was called
Goldilocks because her hair was the colour of gold.

Goldilocks saw the bears’ house. She walked up the path and
knocked on the door. “Nqo-nqo-nqo.” There was no answer. She
peeped in through the window – it looked very nice inside. She rang
the bell, but there was no answer. So do you know what Goldilocks
did? Yes, she walked into the bears’ house! Oh, Goldilocks!
